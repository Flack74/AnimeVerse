## üìù Future Improvements for AnimeVerse API

### Bulk Anime Insertion (Planned Feature)

#### Overview
A potential enhancement for AnimeVerse API is adding support for bulk anime insertion. This would allow users to submit an array of anime data in a single API request, improving efficiency when adding multiple entries.

#### Proposed Route

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/addmultipleanimes`
- **Request Body:** An array of anime JSON objects, e.g.,
  ```json
  [
    {"name": "Attack on Titan", "genre": "Action", "episodes": 75},
    {"name": "Demon Slayer", "genre": "Adventure", "episodes": 26}
  ]
  ```
- **Response:**
  - **Success:** Returns inserted anime details.
  - **Failure:** Returns an error message for invalid or duplicate entries.

#### Considerations
- **MongoDB Free Tier Limitations:** The free plan has a 512MB storage limit, so bulk insertion must be optimized.
- **Duplicate Handling:** Implement logic to prevent inserting duplicate anime based on name.
- **Abuse Prevention:** Consider adding rate limiting or authentication to prevent excessive API calls.
- **Performance Optimization:** Using MongoDB‚Äôs InsertMany function would be more efficient than inserting each entry individually.
